 <summary>What to collect for your data</summary>  
 
Here are few factors we have to consider while considering what should we collect:  
+ How the data will be collected
+ Choose data sources : Collecting first-party data is typically perferred method because you know exactly where it came from
+ Decide what data to use
+ How much data to collect
+ Select the right datatype
 <details><summary>How the data will be collected</summary>
Decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive (and possibly purchase it) from another party. Data that you collect yourself is called first-party data.  
 </details>  
 
## Data sources  
If you don’t collect the data using your own resources, you might get data from second-party or third-party data providers. Second-party data is collected directly by another group and then sold. Third-party data is sold by a provider that didn’t collect the data themselves. Third-party data might come from a number of different sources.  
### First-party data
``
Data collected by an individual or group by using their own reference.
``
### Second-party data
`` 
Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold. In our example, if you aren't able to collect your own data, you might buy it from an organization that's led traffic pattern studies in your city.
 ``
 ### Third-party Data
 ``
 Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. This data might have come from a number of different sources before you investigated it. It might not be as reliable, but that doesn't mean it can't be useful. You'll just want to make sure you check it for accuracy, bias, and credibility.
 ``
 ### Note
 ``
 no matter what kind of data you use, it needs to be inspected for accuracy and trustworthiness.
 ``  
   
Just remember that the data you choose should apply to your needs, and it must be approved for use. As a data analyst, it's your job to decide what data to use, and that means choosing the data that can help you find answers and solve problems and not getting distracted by other data. In traffic example, financial data probably wouldn't be that helpful, but existing data about high volume traffic times would be.
## Solving your business problem  
Datasets can show a lot of interesting information. But be sure to choose data that can actually help solve your problem question. For example, if you are analyzing trends over time, make sure you use time series data — in other words, data that includes dates.  
## How much data Needs to be collect:   
If you are collecting your own data, make reasonable decisions about sample size. A random sample from existing data might be fine for some projects. Other projects might need more strategic data collection to focus on certain criteria. Each project has its own needs.   
In data analytics,`` a population refers to all possible data values in a certain data set.`` If you're analyzing data about car traffic in a city, your population would be all the cars in that area. But collecting data from the entire population can be pretty challenging. That's why a sample can be useful.`` A sample is a part of a population that is representative of the population.`` You might collect a data sample about one spot in the city and analyze the traffic there, or you might pull a random sample from all existing data in the population.  
## Select the right data:
make sure you select the right data type. For traffic data, an appropriate data type could be the dates of traffic records stored in a date format. The dates could help you figure what days of the week there is likely to be a high volume of traffic in the future.

### Time frame
If you are collecting your own data, decide how long you will need to collect it, especially if you are tracking trends over a long period of time. If you need an immediate answer, you might not have time to collect new data. In this case, you would need to use historical data that already exists.    
Use the flowchart below if data collection relies heavily on how much time you have:

 <summary>The structure of data</summary>
   
 Data is everywhere and it can be stored in lots of ways. Two general categories of data are: 
  
- **Structured data:** Organized in a certain format, such as rows and columns.

- **Unstructured data:** Not organized in any easy-to-identify way.
  
For example, when you rate your favorite restaurant online, you're creating structured data. But when you use Google Earth to check out a satellite image of a restaurant location, you're using unstructured data. 
  
Here's a refresher on the characteristics of structured and unstructured data:

## Structured data  
As we described earlier, structured data is organized in a certain format. This makes it easier to store and query for business needs. If the data is exported, the structure goes along with the data.

## Unstructured data  
Unstructured data can’t be organized in any easily identifiable manner. And there is much more unstructured than structured data in the world. Video and audio files, text files, social media content, satellite imagery, presentations, PDF files, open-ended survey responses, and websites all qualify as types of unstructured data. 

## The fairness issue  
The lack of structure makes unstructured data difficult to search, manage, and analyze. But recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are beginning to change that. Now, the new challenge facing data scientists is making sure these tools are inclusive and unbiased. Otherwise, certain elements of a dataset will be more heavily weighted and/or represented than others. And as you're learning, an unfair dataset does not accurately represent the population, causing skewed outcomes, low accuracy levels, and unreliable analysis.

 <summary>Data modeling levels and techniques</summary>
     
Data models help keep data consistent and enable people to map out how data is organized. A basic understanding makes it easier for analysts and other stakeholders to make sense of their data and use it in the right ways. 
  
**Important note:** As a junior data analyst, you won't be asked to design a data model. But you might come across existing data models your organization already has in place. 
   
## What is data modeling?
  
Data modeling is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured.  These visual representations are called data models. You can think of data modeling as a blueprint of a house. At any point, there might be electricians, carpenters, and plumbers using that blueprint. Each one of these builders has a different relationship to the blueprint, but they all need it to understand the overall structure of the house. Data models are similar; different users might have different data needs, but the data model gives them an understanding of the structure as a whole. 
 
## Levels of data modeling
Each level of data modeling has a different level of detail.

- Conceptual data modeling gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details. 

- Logical data modeling focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.

- Physical data modeling depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.


## Data-modeling techniques
There are a lot of approaches when it comes to developing data models, but two common methods are the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram. ERDs are a visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model. UML diagrams are very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships. As a junior data analyst, you will need to understand that there are different data modeling techniques, but in practice, you will probably be using your organization’s existing technique.   
  

## Data analysis and data modeling
Data modeling can help you explore the high-level details of your data and how it is related across the organization’s information systems. Data modeling sometimes requires data analysis to understand how the data is put together; that way, you know how to map the data. And finally, data models make it easier for everyone in your organization to understand and collaborate with you on your data. This is important for you and everyone on your team!
