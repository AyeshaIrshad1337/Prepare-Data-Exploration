## What to collect for your data  
Here are few factors we have to consider while considering what should we collect:  
+ How the data will be collected
+ Choose data sources : Collecting first-party data is typically perferred method because you know exactly where it came from

### First-party data
``
Data collected by an individual or group by using their own reference.
``
### Second-party data
`` 
Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold. In our example, if you aren't able to collect your own data, you might buy it from an organization that's led traffic pattern studies in your city.
 ``
 ### Third-party Data
 ``
 Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. This data might have come from a number of different sources before you investigated it. It might not be as reliable, but that doesn't mean it can't be useful. You'll just want to make sure you check it for accuracy, bias, and credibility.
 ``
 ### Note
 ``
 no matter what kind of data you use, it needs to be inspected for accuracy and trustworthiness.
 ``  
   
Just remember that the data you choose should apply to your needs, and it must be approved for use. As a data analyst, it's your job to decide what data to use, and that means choosing the data that can help you find answers and solve problems and not getting distracted by other data. In traffic example, financial data probably wouldn't be that helpful, but existing data about high volume traffic times would be.
